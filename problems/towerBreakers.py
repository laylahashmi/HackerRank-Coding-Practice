# Two players are playing a game of Tower Breakers! Player  always moves first, and both players always play optimally.
# The rules of the game are as follows:
#
# Initially there are n towers.
# Each tower is of height m.
# The players move in alternating turns.
# In each turn, a player can choose a tower of height x and reduce its height to y, where  1 <= y < x and y evenly divides x.
# If the current player is unable to make a move, they lose the game.
# Given the values of  and , determine which player will win. If the first player wins, return 1. Otherwise, return 2.
